# Device Bridge: iOS Simulator Support

## Goal

Add iOS simulator streaming to the device bridge, following the same architecture as ChromeOS and Android physical devices: a small native daemon that speaks the shared binary framing protocol over stdin/stdout, launched as a subprocess by the Go sidecar.

## Background

The iOS simulator exposes its framebuffer as a shared-memory **IOSurface** via Apple's private `SimulatorKit` framework. This is the same mechanism used by Facebook's IDB (`idb_companion`) and the Simulator.app GUI itself. Direct IOSurface access is orders of magnitude faster than `xcrun simctl io screenshot` (~500ms per frame, limited to ~2 FPS).

For input injection, the simulator accepts **IndigoHID** messages — a Mach message-based protocol used internally by SimulatorKit. IDB reverse-engineered the structs and provides MIT-licensed headers we can reference.

## Architecture

Same subprocess-with-framing pattern as ChromeOS and Android:

```
Go sidecar ──(stdin/stdout framing)──► ios-sim-server ──(IOSurface + IndigoHID)──► Simulator
```

Compare with existing device types:

| Device Type | Daemon | Transport | Frame Source | Input Method |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Android emulator | — (gRPC built-in) | gRPC | Emulator gRPC API | Emulator gRPC API |
| Android physical | `yep-device-server.apk` | TCP via `adb forward` | `SurfaceControl.screenshot()` | `InputManager.injectInputEvent()` |
| ChromeOS | `daemon.py` | SSH stdin/stdout | `drm_screenshot_jpeg()` | evdev (`VirtualMouse`, keyboard) |
| **iOS simulator** | **`ios-sim-server`** | **stdin/stdout** | **IOSurface → VideoToolbox JPEG** | **IndigoHID via SimDeviceLegacyClient** |

## iOS Simulator Daemon (`ios-sim-server`)

A Swift command-line tool (~300 lines) built with Swift Package Manager. Takes a simulator UDID as its sole argument.

### Frame capture

1. Create `SimServiceContext` for the active Xcode developer dir, then construct `SimDeviceSet` with `initWithSetPath:serviceContext:`
2. Look up the booted `SimDevice` by UDID by iterating `deviceSet.devices` (do not rely on `bootedDevices`, which was `nil` in the local spike)
3. Get the main display's IOSurface from the **port descriptor** implementing `SimDisplayIOSurfaceRenderable` via `framebufferSurface` (or `.ioSurface` on older Xcode)
3. Wrap IOSurface in a `CVPixelBuffer` via `CVPixelBufferCreateWithIOSurface()`
4. On each 0x01 frame request:
   - Optionally scale with `vImageScale_ARGB8888` (Accelerate framework) for bandwidth reduction
   - Encode to JPEG via `VideoToolbox` (`VTCompressionSession` with `kCMVideoCodecType_JPEG`) using hardware acceleration
   - Write 0x02 response with JPEG payload to stdout

Two frame modes (matching IDB's approach):

- **Eager (default):** On 0x01 request, re-read the current IOSurface pixel buffer and encode. The IOSurface is always current — it's shared memory. Simple polling, no callback registration needed.
- **Lazy (future optimization):** Register a `damageRectanglesCallback` on the display descriptor. Only encode when the screen actually changes. Reduces CPU for static screens.

Start with eager mode — it's simpler and matches the Android/ChromeOS pull model.

### Input injection

Uses the IndigoHID mechanism from SimulatorKit:

1. Load `SimulatorKit.framework` and resolve three C functions via `dlsym`:
   - `IndigoHIDMessageForMouseNSEvent` — touch events
   - `IndigoHIDMessageForKeyboardArbitrary` — key events
   - `IndigoHIDMessageForButton` — hardware buttons (home, lock, siri)

2. Create a `SimDeviceLegacyHIDClient` (from SimulatorKit) initialized with the `SimDevice`

3. On each 0x03 control command:
   - Parse JSON payload (`{"cmd":"touch",...}` or `{"cmd":"key",...}`)
   - Build the appropriate `IndigoMessage` struct
   - Send via `client.sendWithMessage(_:freeWhenDone:)`

Touch coordinates arrive as normalized 0–1 values (matching Android/ChromeOS). Convert to IndigoHID's ratio format:
```
xRatio = touch.x  (already 0–1, from top-left)
yRatio = touch.y
```

### Handshake

Same 4-byte handshake as Android/ChromeOS:
```
[width uint16 LE][height uint16 LE]
```

Screen dimensions from `SimDisplayDescriptorState.defaultWidthForDisplay` / `defaultHeightForDisplay`, or read directly from the IOSurface dimensions.

### Wire protocol

Identical to Android and ChromeOS — the shared binary framing protocol:

```
Handshake (daemon → sidecar on connect):
  [width uint16 LE][height uint16 LE]

Frame request (sidecar → daemon):
  [0x01]

Frame response (daemon → sidecar):
  [0x02][4-byte LE JPEG length][JPEG bytes]

Control command (sidecar → daemon, fire-and-forget):
  [0x03][4-byte LE JSON length][JSON bytes]
```

### Private framework headers

Referenced from IDB's `PrivateHeaders/` directory (MIT-licensed). We need a minimal subset:

| Header | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Indigo.h` | IndigoMessage, IndigoTouch, IndigoButton structs |
| `Mach.h` | MachMessageHeader for IndigoMessage |
| `SimDisplayIOSurfaceRenderable-Protocol.h` | `.framebufferSurface` / `.ioSurface` access |
| `SimDisplayRenderable-Protocol.h` | `.displaySize`, damage rect callbacks |
| `SimDisplayDescriptorState-Protocol.h` | `.defaultWidthForDisplay`, `.displayClass` |
| `SimDeviceIOPortInterface-Protocol.h` | Port enumeration to find main display |
| `SimDeviceIOProtocol-Protocol.h` | `.ioPorts` on device IO |
| `SimDeviceLegacyClient.h` | `sendWithMessage:freeWhenDone:` for HID input |
| `SimDevice.h` | Device object (`.io`, `.deviceType`, `.UDID`) |
| `SimDeviceSet.h` | `defaultSet.devices` for lookup by UDID |

These are Objective-C headers used via a bridging header in the Swift project.

### Framework dependencies

Linked at build time (all ship with Xcode):

| Framework | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CoreSimulator` | `SimDevice`, `SimDeviceSet` (private, from Xcode) |
| `SimulatorKit` | `SimDeviceLegacyHIDClient`, IndigoHID functions (private, from Xcode) |
| `IOSurface` | IOSurface object wrapping |
| `CoreVideo` | `CVPixelBufferCreateWithIOSurface` |
| `VideoToolbox` | Hardware JPEG encoding |
| `Accelerate` | `vImageScale_ARGB8888` for downscaling |
| `CoreGraphics` | `CGPoint`, `CGSize` |

### Build

Swift Package Manager, single executable target:

```
packages/ios-sim-server/
├── Package.swift
├── Sources/
│   ├── main.swift              # Entry point, stdin/stdout framing loop
│   ├── Framebuffer.swift       # IOSurface access + JPEG encoding
│   ├── HIDInput.swift          # IndigoHID touch/key/button injection
│   └── BridgeHeaders/          # Obj-C bridging header + private headers
│       ├── bridge.h
│       ├── Indigo.h
│       ├── Mach.h
│       └── ... (subset from IDB PrivateHeaders)
└── Tests/
    └── ... (framing protocol round-trip)
```

Build command:
```bash
cd packages/ios-sim-server
swift build -c release \
  -Xlinker -F/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/PrivateFrameworks \
  -Xlinker -F/Library/Developer/PrivateFrameworks
```

Output: `.build/release/ios-sim-server`

The built binary must also include runtime `rpath` entries for Xcode/private
framework directories or dyld will fail to locate `SimulatorKit.framework` at
launch.

### Distribution

**Cannot cross-compile** — private frameworks are macOS-only and Xcode-version-specific. Two options:

1. **Build on first use** (preferred): Go sidecar runs `swift build -c release` in `packages/ios-sim-server/` when an iOS simulator device is first selected. Cache the binary alongside the device-bridge binary. Similar to how the Android APK is resolved.

2. **CI pre-build for macOS**: GitHub Actions macOS runner builds the binary and attaches it to releases. Downloaded on-demand like the device-bridge binary. Works only if the user's Xcode version matches the CI build.

Option 1 is more robust since private framework layouts can change between Xcode versions. The build is fast (~5 seconds for a small Swift CLI).

## Go Sidecar: `IOSSimulatorDevice`

Lives in `packages/device-bridge/internal/device/ios_simulator_device.go`. Mirrors `ChromeOSDevice` almost exactly:

```go
type IOSSimulatorDevice struct {
    udid    string
    cmd     *exec.Cmd
    reader  io.ReadCloser
    writer  io.WriteCloser
    width   int32
    height  int32
    writeMu sync.Mutex
    // ...
}

func NewIOSSimulatorDevice(ctx context.Context, udid string) (*IOSSimulatorDevice, error) {
    serverPath := resolveIOSSimServer()  // find or build the binary
    cmd := exec.CommandContext(ctx, serverPath, udid)
    cmd.Stdin, _ = cmd.StdinPipe()   // we write to daemon's stdin
    cmd.Stdout, _ = cmd.StdoutPipe() // we read from daemon's stdout
    cmd.Start()
    // read 4-byte handshake for screen dimensions
    // return device ready for GetFrame/SendTouch/SendKey
}
```

### Discovery

The Go sidecar discovers iOS simulators via:
```bash
xcrun simctl list devices booted -j
```

This returns JSON with all booted simulators. Each gets reported as `type: "ios-simulator"` in the `DeviceInfo` list.

```go
type DeviceInfo struct {
    ID    string  // UDID from simctl
    Label string  // "iPhone 17 Pro (iOS 26.2)"
    Type  string  // "ios-simulator"
    State string  // "booted"
}
```

Client signaling should pass `deviceType: "ios-simulator"` in
`device_stream_start` so server runtime selection never depends on parsing a
UDID-like `deviceId`.

### Binary resolution

Priority order (same pattern as Android APK):
1. `IOS_SIM_SERVER` env var (explicit path)
2. `{data-dir}/bin/ios-sim-server` (pre-downloaded)
3. Build from source: `swift build -c release` in `packages/ios-sim-server/`

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1 — Swift daemon skeleton

1. Create `packages/ios-sim-server/` with Package.swift
2. Copy minimal private headers from IDB `PrivateHeaders/` (Indigo.h, Mach.h, SimDisplay protocols, SimDevice, SimDeviceLegacyClient)
3. Implement `main.swift`:
   - Parse UDID from argv
   - Look up SimDevice by UDID
   - Get IOSurface from main display
   - Write handshake (width/height)
   - Enter read loop: dispatch 0x01 → JPEG frame, 0x03 → HID input
4. Verify: `swift build -c release && echo "test" | .build/release/ios-sim-server <UDID>`

### Step 2 — Frame capture

1. Implement `Framebuffer.swift`:
   - `CVPixelBufferCreateWithIOSurface` to wrap the IOSurface
   - VideoToolbox JPEG compression session (hardware-accelerated)
   - Optional downscaling via `vImageScale_ARGB8888`
2. Verify: manual test capturing frames, compare quality/speed to `simctl screenshot`

### Spike findings on this machine

Validated locally on the booted simulator:

- Booted simulator: `iPhone 17` / `F87D9B80-78AD-4398-B7D4-CA5E74D5474A`
- `xcrun simctl io ... screenshot` baseline: ~`0.52s` for one frame
- `framebufferSurface` access via private frameworks: working
- `SimDeviceLegacyHIDClient initWithDevice:error:`: working
- `IndigoHIDMessageForMouseNSEvent`, `IndigoHIDMessageForKeyboardArbitrary`,
  `IndigoHIDMessageForButton`: all present via `dlsym`
- One-shot IOSurface -> VideoToolbox JPEG encode: working
- In-process steady-state capture + JPEG encode benchmark: ~`218-240 FPS`
  (`~4.2-4.6ms` per frame) on a mostly static simulator screen

These measurements confirm that simulator capture is not the bottleneck.
Production work should therefore keep the existing Go sidecar for WebRTC,
adaptive streaming, and session lifecycle rather than introducing a separate
Swift-side streaming stack.

### Recommended production shape

#### V1

- Keep `ios-sim-server` as a tiny macOS-only daemon responsible only for:
  - simulator discovery by UDID
  - IOSurface access
  - VideoToolbox JPEG encode
  - IndigoHID input injection
  - stdin/stdout framing
- Integrate through the existing Go sidecar as `IOSSimulatorDevice`
- Reuse the existing `Device` pull-frame path and WebRTC stack unchanged

This matches the current ChromeOS subprocess model and minimizes platform-
specific complexity in the main bridge.

#### V2 optimization only if needed

If end-to-end tests show JPEG decode/re-encode is too expensive, upgrade the
simulator path to push H.264 directly and implement `StreamCapable` in the Go
bridge. Do not start there; the simpler JPEG-framed path should land first.

### Step 3 — Input injection

1. Implement `HIDInput.swift`:
   - Load SimulatorKit, resolve IndigoHID functions via `dlsym`
   - Create `SimDeviceLegacyHIDClient`
   - Touch: build IndigoMessage from normalized coordinates
   - Key: build IndigoMessage from keycode
   - Button: home, lock, siri
2. Verify: send touch events, confirm simulator responds

### Step 4 — Go sidecar integration

1. Add `ios_simulator_device.go` — subprocess management + framing protocol
2. Add iOS simulator discovery to device list (parse `xcrun simctl list devices booted -j`)
3. Add `type: "ios-simulator"` to `DeviceInfo`
4. Wire into `SessionManager` and pool

### Step 5 — Tests

- **Go: `IOSSimulatorDevice` with mock subprocess** — `io.Pipe()` fake, same pattern as ChromeOS tests
- **Go: simctl JSON parsing** — unit test for device list parsing
- **E2E: iOS simulator streaming** (skips if no booted simulator) — same structure as emulator E2E test

## Performance Expectations

| Metric | `simctl screenshot` | `ios-sim-server` (IOSurface) |
|---|---|---|
| Frame latency | ~500ms | ~4-5ms steady-state encode on local spike |
| Max FPS | ~2 | 200+ local encode loop, likely lower end-to-end |
| Encoding | N/A (file I/O) | VideoToolbox hardware JPEG |
| Scaling | Not supported | `vImageScale_ARGB8888` before encode |
| Process overhead | New process per frame | Persistent process, shared memory |

---

## Xcode Version Compatibility

The private frameworks change between Xcode versions. Known variations:

- **IOSurface access**: Xcode 13.2+ split `ioSurface` into `framebufferSurface` + `maskedFramebufferSurface`. The daemon tries `framebufferSurface` first, falls back to `ioSurface`.
- **HID client class**: `SimDeviceLegacyHIDClient` has been stable since Xcode 9+.
- **IndigoHID functions**: Stable since Xcode 9+, loaded dynamically via `dlsym` so missing symbols fail gracefully.
- **Device set lookup**: `+[SimDeviceSet defaultSet]` was unavailable in the
  local spike; constructing `SimDeviceSet` via `SimServiceContext` was stable.
- **Display lookup**: `framebufferSurface` was exposed on the display
  **descriptor proxy**, not the port object itself, in the local spike.

Building from source on the user's machine (Step 1 distribution option) sidesteps most compatibility issues since it links against the locally-installed frameworks.

## Non-Goals

- Physical iOS device support (requires `usbmuxd` + developer disk images — completely different stack)
- Audio streaming from simulator
- Multiple simultaneous simulator displays (only main display class 0)
- Xcode-less operation (private frameworks require Xcode installed)
